# Dotfiles

My configuration files for bash, vim, tmux and so forth.

The intention is to be able to run  a setup script after cloning the repo on a Mac system and be up and running very quickly.

# Setup Notes

## MAC

```bash
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/Repos/github.com/dbonne
mkdir -p $DOTFILES_DIR
cd $DOTFILES_DIR
git clone https://github.com/dbonne/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```
